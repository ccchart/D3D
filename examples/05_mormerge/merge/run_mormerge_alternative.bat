    rem This is an alternative way to start a mormerge calculation on Windows.
    rem It does not use the script "mormerge.tcl" to start all processes.
    rem Disadvantage is that you have to prepare the calculation manually.
    rem Only use this script if you are an experienced user.

    rem Needed manual preparations:
    rem - Create the condition subdirectories and copy the (correct) input files in it
    rem - Adapt this script for your environment and model. Currently, it is tuned for:
