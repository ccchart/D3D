This testcase is an example to use the Delft3D-FLOW functionality called mormerge

Prerequisites
=============
Tcl must be installed on the machine where the mormerge calculation is executed.
Tcl is installed by default on most Linux machines.
Tcl is open source and can be downloaded from http://www.activestate.com

Running the mormerge testcase
=============================
- Build the Delft3D open source code (release version) in directory ".../src".
  When this is finished, binaries will be installed in directory ".../bin".
- Go to subdirectory ".../examples/05_mormerge/merge" and
  execute script "run_flow2d3d_wave_mormerge" with extension ".sh" (Linux) or ".bat" (Windows).
  Several command boxes will appear, one after each other. They will disappear when the calculation is finished.

- Directory ".../examples/05_mormerge/merge/sync" will be created, containing files showing the progress of all FLOW and MORMERGE processes.
- All model output is in the "condition"-directories:
  ".../examples/05_mormerge\0deg"
  ".../examples/05_mormerge\45deg"
  etcetera
  Each of these directories contain a file named "deltares_hydro.scr" and optionally "wave.scr", containing the screen output.
  All conditions will have identical bedlevels.

    The mormerge algorithm
    ======================
    Define different conditions for basicly the same model. For example by varying wind, wave or boundary conditions.
    All conditions must be identical on the following items:
    - Grid-dimensions
    - Initial bedlevel
    - Morphology being modelled; Start time for bed updating must be identical
