c Module description: This routine calculates the "from" and "to"
c                     lengths for each segment exchange.
c
c                     The routine uses the pointer table. Each exchange
c                     is defined by a "from" segment number and a "to"
c                     segment number. A "from" length is half the seg-
c                     ment length of a "from" segment number and a "to"
c                     length is half the segment length of a "to" seg-
c                     ment number. A special case is formed by a negati-
c                     ve segment number (boundary). In that case the
c                     "from" and "to" lengths are each half the length
c                     of the positive segment length. The segment
c                     lengths have already been calculated by routine
c                     WQSLEN.
