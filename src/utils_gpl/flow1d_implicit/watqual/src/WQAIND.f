c Module description: This routine calculates the exchange area between
c                     two segments in a node.
c
c                     This routine is more complex and works in a diffe-
c                     rent manner as the routines WQAIGP and WQABGP. The
c                     problem is that more than one exchange is needed
c                     from the list of exchanges. This list is used to
c                     determine exchange flows. For instance the follow-
c                     ing problem:
c
c                                      ------------
c                                      |          |
c                               1 -----|-|      |-|----- 1
c                     Seg I     2 -----|-|1    2|-|----- 2      Seg II
c                               3 -----|-|      |-|----- 3
c                                      |          |
c                                      |  node 1  |
c                                      ------------
c
c                     This results in a list of exchanges from segment I
c                     to segment II (node,gridpoint/section):
c
c                     I,11 -> 21 and I,11 -> 22 and I,11 -> 23
c                     I,12 -> 21 and I,12 -> 22 and I,12 -> 23
c                     I,13 -> 21 and I,13 -> 22 and I,13 -> 23
c
c                     To calculate the exchange area between the two
c                     segments the section areas of grid point 1 should
c                     be added and the section areas for grid point 2.
c                     As can be seen in the list the gridpoint/section
c                     combination can occur more then once. Therefore
c                     the combination of gridpoint and section will be
c                     processed only once.
c
c                     Each time routine WQABGP and WQAIGP is called one
c                     definition will be processed. In case the exchange
c                     is in a node WQAIND will process all definitions
c                     which have the same node number.
c                     Therefore when the routine is called with a node
c                     number first a check is made if the node had been
c                     processed before.
c
c                     When all definitions are processed two segment
c                     areas are known in the node. The exchange area is
c                     then calculated by taking the minimum of both
c                     areas.
