c Module description: This routine calculates the exchange areas for one
c                     time step.
c
c                     The routine uses the pointer table and the exchan-
c                     ge definition table. The pointer table gives in-
c                     formation about segment exchanges in the form
c                     segment i -> segment j. Each exchange is defined
c                     by one or more exchange definitions. Three types
c                     are possible:
c
c                     -   Exchange in a gridpoint (I);
c                     -   Exchange between two gridpoints (II);
c                     -   Exchange in a node (III);
c                     -   Exchange between lateral station and grid-cell
c                         (IV).
c
c                     For these types the following information will be
c                     available:
c
c                     Type I:
c                     -   gridpoint
c                     -   section from
c                     -   section to
c
c                     Type II:
c                     -   gridpoint from
c                     -   gridpoint to
c                     -   section
c                     -   length factor (0 < length factor < 1)
c
c                     Type III:
c                     -   node number
c                     -   gridpoint from
c                     -   gridpoint to
c                     -   section from
c                     -   section to
c
c                     For each type of exchange a different algorithm
c                     must be used. An exchange area for the first ex-
c                     change type is calculated by determination of the
c                     minimum area. An exchange area for the second type
c                     is determined by interpolating between the two
c                     areas known at the two gridpoints.
c                     The last one is more complex. First the total area
c                     of each of the two segments is determined by sum-
c                     ming the areas of the working units connected to
c                     this node. Subsequently, the exchange area for
c                     DELWAQ is found by taking the minimum (likewise
c                     for type 1) of these two areas.
c
c                     An exchange area always must have a value > 0. In
c                     case a zero area is calculated the area will be
c                     set to 1 cm2. For exchanges from a negative to a
c                     positive segment (Lateral discharge) the exchange
c                     area will be set to 1 cm2.
