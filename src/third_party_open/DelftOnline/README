This is the online communiction library that is one of the requirements for Delft3D. 
These should be installed so Delft3D can find them during configure time. 
See the INSTALL file for details on the installation. 

If you don't install into the default location (/usr/local) then you should specify the location in the FCFLAGS and CFLAGS and in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
