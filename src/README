  3) <Ctrl><Shift>B
  4) The binaries are installed in directory "bin\w32" (release) 
     or in the subdirectory of the executable, e.g. "src\engines_gpl\deltares_hydro\bin\Debug" (debug)


Compiling on Linux
==================
  1) In directory "src": ./build.sh
     Debug version: build.sh -debug
  2) The binaries are installed in directory "bin\intel"
To clean on Linux (removing all files generated by autoreconf/configure/make):
  make distclean


Directory structure
===================
engines     : Programs which perform a physical simulation
engines_gpl : Open source engines under GPL conditions
tools       : Programs which support the engines 
tools_gpl   : Open source tools under GPL conditions
utils       : Libraries which are used by the engines and/or tools, but at least by more than one engine/tool
