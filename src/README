Compiling on Windows
====================
  0) Be sure that you have installed:
     Visual Studio 2008, including Fortran compiler Intel 11.0
  1) Open "src\deltares_hydro_open_source.sln" in Visual Studio
  2) Select the "solution configuration you want: Debug or Release
  3) <Ctrl><Shift>B
  4) The binaries are installed in directory "bin\w32" (release) 
     or in the subdirectory of the executable, e.g. "src\engines_gpl\deltares_hydro\bin\Debug" (debug)


Compiling on Linux
==================
  1) In directory "src": ./build.sh
     Debug version: build.sh -debug
  2) The binaries are installed in directory "bin\intel"
  3) To clean (removing all files generated by autoreconf/configure/make):
     make distclean
  4) 64 bit version
     This is under construction
     Be careful with compilers having a different revision or build number; this will lead to different paths
     Be careful with tools located in different directories (e.q. /opt/mpich2)
     Check both "common.am" and "build.sh"

Directory structure
===================
engines     : Programs which perform a physical simulation
engines_gpl : Open source engines under GPL conditions
tools       : Programs which support the engines 
tools_gpl   : Open source tools under GPL conditions
utils       : Libraries which are used by the engines and/or tools, but at least by more than one engine/tool
utils_lgpl  : Open source utils under LGPL conditions
