    rem When using intelMPI for the first time on a machine:
    rem Execute "hydra_service.exe -install" as administrator:
    rem     Preparation: Check that your Delft3D installation contains "...\x64\share\bin\hydra_service.exe". Optionally copy it to a local directory (it will run as a service).
    rem     "Windows Start button" -> type "cmd", right-click "Command Prompt" App, "Run as Administrator"
    rem     In this command box:
    rem         cd ...\x64\share\bin (or your local copy)
    rem         hydra_service.exe -install
    rem         mpiexec.exe -register -username <user> -password <password> -noprompt
    rem     When there is an hydra_service/smpd already running on the machine, it must be ended first, using the Microsoft Task Manager, 
    rem     or in the command  box: hydra_service.exe -uninstall (smpd -uninstall)
