!   Function:   computes the difference segments of the  (Xi,Yi) of the collinear lines 
!               (qx,qy)-(q2x,q2y) and (px,py)-(p2x,p2y).  vectors Xi and Yi contain the 
!               x- and y-coordinates of the begin and end point (in random order) of the
!               intersection part, that can also coincide!
!               typeINTER = 1: If segments not collinear  (eitehr If the lines are parallel
!               but not coincident or If the (infinite) line passing for the segments intercept 
!              (i.e. not parallel).
!               typeINTER = 2 if line are collinear 
!               In output:  the first column of xi and yi always has the subsegment of segment 1,
!                           and the second column of xi and yi always have the subsegment of segment 2
!
!   Algorithm: (Based on Gareth Rees' 2-dimensional specialization of the 3D line intersection algorithm from the article 
!               "Intersection of two lines in three-space" by Ronald Goldman, published in Graphics Gems, page 304. 
!               In three dimensions, the usual case is that the lines are skew (neither parallel nor intersecting) 
!               in which case the method gives the points of closest approach of the two lines.)

!
!   The two lines below intersect in i if we can find t and u such that:  p + t r = q + u s .
!
!           p+r \    / q+s                     with  s=(sx,sy) ; r=(rx,ry) 
!                \  /
!                 \/ i=(xi,yi)
!                 /\                          Solution:
!                /  \                         t = (q - p) x s / (r x s)      (x is a two-dimensional cross-product)
!    q=(qx,qy)  /    \ p=(px,py)              u = (q - p) x r / (r x s)           
!
!case 1) if r x s = 0 then the two lines are parallel. There are two subcases:
!        1a) if (q - p) x r = 0 too, then the lines are collinear
!        1b) otherwise: they never intersect. 
!case 2) Otherwise the intersection point is on the original pair of line segments if 0 =< t =< 1 and 0 =< u =< 1.
