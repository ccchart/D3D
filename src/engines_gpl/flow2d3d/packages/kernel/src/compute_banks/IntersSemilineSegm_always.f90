!   Function:   computes the intersection point(s) (Xi,Yi) of a semiline (starting from
!               the point (qx,qy), passing through point (q2x,q2y) and extending to
!               infinite) with the segment (px,py)-(p2x,p2y). If there is one intersection 
!               point typeINTER=1 and Xi and Yi contain the x- and y-coordinate of this 
!               point, respectively. If the intersection is outside the segments, it returns
!               typeINTER = 3. In this case if NEAREST_or_int=0 the point of the segment nearest
!               to point (qx,qy) is returned, while if NEAREST_or_int=1 the intersection is returned.
!               If the interseption is outside the semiline, it returns typeINTER = 4 (i.e. wrong side of the semiline)
!               IMPORTANT Note: "_always" in the subroutine name implies that the 
!               infinite lines containing the segments and the semiline always intersect somewhere,
!               i.e. the line are not parallel and the segments are not of zero length (these are
!               always verified when looking for boundary intersections in the ghost cell method)
!
!   Algorithm: (Based on Gareth Rees' 2-dimensional specialization of the 3D line intersection algorithm from the article 
!               "Intersection of two lines in three-space" by Ronald Goldman, published in Graphics Gems, page 304. 
!               In three dimensions, the usual case is that the lines are skew (neither parallel nor intersecting) 
!               in which case the method gives the points of closest approach of the two lines.)

!
!   The two lines below intersect in i if we can find t and u such that:  p + t r = q + u s .
!
!           p+r \    / q+s                     with  s=(sx,sy) ; r=(rx,ry) 
!                \  /
!                 \/ i=(xi,yi)
!                 /\                          Solution:
!                /  \                         t = (q - p) x s / (r x s)      (x is a two-dimensional cross-product)
!    q=(qx,qy)  /    \ p=(px,py)              u = (q - p) x r / (r x s)           
!
! The intersection point is on the original pair of semiline/segment  if 0 =< t =< 1 and 0 =< u =< infinite.
