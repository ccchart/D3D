USE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

NOTE aggregate nrs are composed of TRWP class nr and SS class nr

As compared to the ETRMA model:
- we do not include soil in the WQ model (EHype based version had the full monty of 12 layers)

INITIAL VERSION for SETAC

All SS relations de-activated:
properties of SS and aggregates 
settling of SS and aggregates
degradation in soils
degradation in sediments
burial in sediments

Some minute softwaere changes
sumtyr: protect agains missing S1 layer
tyrtra: idem
some defaults changed in tables to enable this

PRE-FINAL VERSION

We need to proceed to 2 fractions of natural particles
For both fractions we have input
Concentration in surface water (g/m3)
Settling flux (g/s or g/d)
Resuspension flux (g/s or g/d)

Modified:
Settling of TRWP distributed over aggregates in proportion to settling fluxes

For simplicity all resuspension / burial integrated + calculation kBurial
All resuspension tables removed
SumTyr drastically simplified

Full test seems to work fine.


TODO:
Change settling formulation

CLEANING IN THE END
Remove erosion process that "emits" Suspi
Remove Susp3-6


QUESTIONS TO HELENE
Can we attribute a settling velocity to the fractions?
Could that be direct input or can we provide particle properties and calculate?

FINAL VERSION

The plan did not work, we go back to using just the erosion, and do the rest as before.
And simplify, get rid of the soil related tricks

The erosion part needs to be modified
What hydraulics do we need? Depth, velocity and Tau
Reprogrammed TyrTra without complexity of E-Hype

The settling of TRWP reverted to what it was
Any need for FrSusp? NO
Any need for SuspSed? Yes, but as 2 fractions only

FINAL FINAL VERSION

Helene updated the coupling to the sediment model, to include 5 fractions
I would like at least to maintain a version that has max 6 fractions of both TRWP and SS and 36 aggregates
Some processes loop over the fractions, some are split
For the split ones we can omit fractions by omitting processes
For the unsplit ones we could optimize by introducing the actula fractions count as a parameter
Ideally all processes should loop over fractions.
I truly do not understand why Arjen split them

For testing, we will restore all processes that loop over fractions to 6x6
DONE

Now there are a few small things remaining
- arrange the link between EM and WQ in a decent way
- avoid the use of nrofsegl.inc, for that I need helen to write dummy surfaces for EM
