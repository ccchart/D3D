!     subroutines called    : getdim  - retrieve proper array dimensions
!                                       by scanning input files
!                             pointrs - make pointers and allocate arrays
!                             delpar  - activate former 'static' main program
!
!     explanation:
!     this (new) main program was required for the 'dynamic memory' version
!     of delpar, and replaces the former 'static' main program.
!
!     for delpar the dynamic memory allocation is based on fmm (flexible
!     memory manager) as developped by wl|Deltares, and fully
!     fortran 77.
!
!     for the 'dynamic version' of delpar the 'static' main program was
!     converted to a subroutine delpar. the changes could be restricted
!     to commenting out the parameter statement used by former static arrays.
!     in the call to delpar at the end of this module all former static
!     arrays are now passed dynamically by their pointer referring to the
!     fmm arrays , like
!          i for integer
!          r for reals
!          c for character
!     notice that we use a shorthand notation for the original (longer)
!     fmm names (see the include-file alias.inc)
!
!     first in routine getdim the 'static' array dimensions will be retrieved
!     from scanning the input files.
!     after that in routine pointrs all former static arrays will be allocated
!     dynamically, with their actual size based on the retrieved user input files,
!     thus allocating exactly the proper size for that delpar run.
!
!     major objective for implementing the 'dynamic' version of delpar was
!     1) keeping the 'dynamic' code as close as possible to the 'static' code
!        by introducing the dynamic fmm arrays already on the top level
!        (=main program), rather than inserting this fmm code into the 'old'
!        main program.
!     2) preserving an optimal coherence (traceability) between the 'static'
!        and the 'dynamic' memory allocations by using same naming conventions.
!        example for memory allocation for concentration array aconc:
!            static  memory: dimension aconc (nosubx*nwmax)
!            dynamic memory: aconc = mkgtrp('aconc',nosubx*nwmax)
!            (mkgtrp = make and get real pointer for fmm)
