\section{Beschrijving van script waq\_balans.py}

This programme makes use of the mass balance ascii (prn) output files from delwaq.
Two files can be used as input so that they can be compared.

if substance in allsubs: this is the first main loop through the substances 

\begin{description}
	\item for ifile in range(len(infile)): the second loop through the (maximum) two input files, it was not tested if only one input file is used.
\end{description}

At the end of the ifile loop all the terms are stored in indum (for both files)
In de structure 'results' are all output included of the two files for that substance so that this can be converted two one dataframe that can be stored as an excel file. 

I can search the structure on strings or values using something like:
test = list(filter(lambda x:'Storage' in x, results)). The names that we want to compare are stored in varname

This gives all occurences and then I can do the output as I please.
