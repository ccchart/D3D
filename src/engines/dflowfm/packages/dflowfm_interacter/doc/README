
1. Create on toplevel (next to "src", "examples") directory "build_dflowfm_interacter"
2. In "build_dflowfm_interacter", execute:
   cmake ..\src\cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64 -B "." -D CONFIGURATION_TYPE="dflowfm_interacter"
3. Copy https://repos.deltares.nl/repos/ds/branches/dflowfm/dflowfm_interacter/third_party/interacter
   To
   "third_party\interacter"
4. In "build_dflowfm_interacter\dflowfm_interacter.sln":
   dflowfm_interacter project -> properties -> Linker -> General -> Link Library Dependencies = Yes
5. Compile
6. To debug:
   - Add to working dir: .ini/.hlp files from "src\engines_gpl\dflowfm\res"
   - Add to command line options: --display:opengl=0
7. When running D-Flow FM via Interacter, the GUI may possibly be blocked (and does not open). To solve this:
   Open "Task Manager" -> tab "Performance" -> "Open Resource Manager" link at the bottom, right-click on "dflowfm.exe" process, "Analyze Wait Chain", end all processes in the list.
